# Diffeological sp.(Diff)

$X$ with  a family of maps $U\to X$ (plots), $U$: open subset of $\R^n$

1. constant map is a plot
2. $U\to X$ is a plot, $V\to U$ is smooth => $V\to X$ is a plot
3. $U=\bigcup_iU_i$: open cover, restriction $U_i\to X$ is a plot => $U\to X$ is a plot

Mor(Diff):
$f:X\to Y$ is smooth, $g:U\to X$ is a plot => $fg:U\to Y$ is a plot.

smooth manifolds is a full subcat of Diff

### Examples
$T_\alpha = T^2/\R_\alpha \simeq \R/(\Z+\alpha \Z)$, where $\alpha$ is irrational.
